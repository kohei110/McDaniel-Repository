#Simple linear regression using gretl

#Do cigarette taxes (X) reduce smoking (Y)?

#Y: consumption, per capita in the state
#X: cigarette taxes (measured in dollars)

#OUR MODEL: consumption = b0 + b1*cig_tax + error

#We estimate the model using the method of least squares (OLS)

#For a one-dollar increase in cigarette taxes we expect consumption of cigarettes per capita to decrease by 29.8

#Ho: b1 = 0
#Ha: b1 does not = 0

#t-stat = -3.456

#Reject Ho, the coefficient on the cig_tax variable is statistically different from zero (statistically significant)

#R-squared = .19 -> that approximately 19% of the total variation in consumption is explained by its linear relationship with cig_tax
