#Unfortunately, this model is problematic for a number of reasons, not least of which is that
#education is endogenous (and thus also experience is coded as age - education - 6).  So let's
#go to a TSLS Regression.
#
#
#Let's go with a simpler TSLS Regression first and then try more complex ones.
#
#The first, simpler TSLS Regression takes advantageous of what we know about the relationship
#between education, experience and age.

#Don't forget to change the path to where you want the output from your models saved on
#your computer.  Also, if you run this script several times you must close the Word doc
#with your model table between runs or you will get an error message.
