#Part 2 of Problem Set #2 requires the use of a different dataset.  These data are in the 
#data file cokeVsPepsi.gdt.

open "I:\My Passport Documents\McDaniel\DataAnalytics\ANA510\Assignments\PS2\cokeVsPepsi.gdt"

#Make a personal note of anything that seems odd...
#Build a linear model from the data using the price ratio, pratio rather than the individual
#variables for the price of coke and the price of pepsi

cokeLinear <- ols coke const pratio disp_coke disp_pepsi 

cokeProbit <- probit coke const pratio disp_coke disp_pepsi

cokeLogit <- logit coke const pratio disp_coke disp_pepsi

#Now, let's make some predictions using the logit model.
